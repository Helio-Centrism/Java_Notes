//to write any code in a java we first define a class for the given problem
//in this class we define a function main as public static void main(strings args[])
//main function is the first thing the Java compiler finds when it needs to run the java program
/*this code which is given below 
    public class JavaBasics {
        public static void main(String args[]{

    }
is known as boilerplate code because Boilerplate code is the code that is required for every Java program and is not specific to the problem you are trying to solve. It includes defining a class and the main method, which serves as the entry point for your program
